# PixelInspector
A simple utility to zoom in and inspect pixels on the screen

## Background
Way back during the very early days of Windows - 3.1 and possibly as far back as 2.0 or earlier, the Windows SDK included a tool called ZoomIn. At some point, it was removed from the SDK. I don't remember when.

It was a pretty limited tool, and used a scrollbar for changing the zoom level, which is not what a scrollbar is expected to do.
